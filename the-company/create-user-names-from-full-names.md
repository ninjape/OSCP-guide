# Create user names from full names

We can use a tool such as [Username Anarchy](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/username-anarchy) to create common username permutations based on the full names. After saving the full names to a text file, we run the script.

```
./username-anarchy --input-file fullnames.txt --select-format
first,flast,first.last,firstl > unames.txt
```
