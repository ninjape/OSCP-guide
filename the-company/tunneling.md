## SSH Local Port Forwarding

The below command is run on Server A to create the SSH tunnel through Server B and reach Server C.&#x20;

{% code title="the command is run on Server A" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```
ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:4455:172.16.167.217:445 database_admin@10.4.167.215
```
{% endcode %}

kali -> (Server A) 192.168.167.63 -> (Server B) 10.4.167.215->(Server C) 172.16.167.217&#x20;

Now from Kali VM we can reach Server C and access the SMB Server.

```
smbclient -p 4455 -L //192.168.50.63/ -U hr_admin --password=Welcome1234
```

So when you want to reach a port that is open only on the victim machine, but not from your attack host, you will use local port forwarding.

```
ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 user@{target_IP}
```

proxychains nmap -vvv -sT --top-ports=20 -Pn 172.16.50.217
```

## SSH Remote Port Forwarding

While in local and dynamic port forwarding, the listening port is bound to the SSH client, in remote port forwarding, the listening port is bound to the SSH server. Instead of the packet forwarding being done by the SSH server, in remote port forwarding, packets are forwarded by the SSH client.

```
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

{% code title="Checking that the SSH server on the Kali machine is listening." overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```
sudo ss -ntplu
```
{% endcode %}

The SSH remote port forward option is -R, and has a very similar syntax to the local port forward option. It also takes two socket pairs as the argument. The listening socket is defined first, and the forwarding socket is second.

In this case, we want to listen on port 2345 on our Kali machine (127.0.0.1:2345), and forward all traffic to the PostgreSQL port on PGDATABASE01 (10.4.50.215:5432).

```
ssh -N -R 127.0.0.1:2345:10.4.50.215:5432 kali@192.168.118.4
```

{% code title="Checking if port 2345 is bound on the Kali SSH server." overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```
kali@kali:~$ ss -ntplu

```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to connect back to the Kali SSH server using a username and password you may have to explicity allow password-based authentication by setting PasswordAuthentication to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.
{% endhint %}



## SSH Remote Dynamic Port Forwarding

{% hint style="info" %}
Remote dynamic port forwarding has only been available since October 2017's OpenSSH 7.6.2 Despite this, only the OpenSSH client needs to be version 7.6 or above to use it - the server version doesn't matter.
{% endhint %}

The remote dynamic port forwarding command is relatively simple, although (slightly confusingly) it uses the same -R option as classic remote port forwarding. The difference is that when we want to create a remote dynamic port forward, we pass only one socket: the socket we want to listen on the SSH server. We don't even need to specify an IP address; if we just pass a port, it will be bound to the loopback interface of the SSH server by default.

To bind the SOCKS proxy to port 9998 on the loopback interface of our Kali machine, we simply specify -R 9998 to the SSH command we run on CONFLUENCE01. We'll also pass the -N flag to prevent a shell from being opened.

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'


ssh -N -R 9998 kali@192.168.118.4
```

```
kali@kali:~$ tail /etc/proxychains4.conf
#       proxy types: http, socks4, socks5, raw
#         * raw: The traffic is simply forwarded to the proxy without modification.
#        ( auth types supported: "basic"-http  "user/pass"-socks )
#
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks5 127.0.0.1 9998

```

```
proxychains nmap -vvv -sT --top-ports=20 -Pn -n 10.4.50.64
```

## SSHuttle

In situations where we have direct access to an SSH server, behind which is a more complex internal network, classic dynamic port forwarding might be difficult to manage. sshuttle1 is a tool that turns an SSH connection into something similar to a VPN by setting up local routes that force traffic through the SSH tunnel. However, it requires root privileges on the SSH client and Python3 on the SSH server, so it's not always the most lightweight option. In the appropriate scenario, however, it can be very useful.

```
sshuttle -r database_admin@192.168.50.63:2222 10.4.50.0/24 172.16.50.0/24
```

## Reverse tunnel to attack host

UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null and StrictHostKeyChecking=no. The first option prevents ssh from attempting to save the host key by sending the output to /dev/null. The second option will instruct ssh to not prompt us to accept the host key. Both of these options can be set via the -o flag.

```
ssh -f -N -R 1122:10.5.5.11:22 -R 13306:10.5.5.11:3306 -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/nul
l" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -i /tmp/keys/id_rsa kali@10.11.0.4
```

\+ generate and use keys (page 779 PWK)

## Reverse dynamic port forwarding

newer versions of ssh support this feature

We will only need one port forwarding option, which is -R 1080. By not including a host after the port, ssh is instructed to create a SOCKS proxy on our Kali server. We also need to change the location of the private key

```
ssh -f -N -D 1080 -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -i /
var/lib/mysql/.ssh/id_rsa kali@10.11.0.4
```

### Proxychains

configure proxychains on Kali to use the SOCKS proxy. We can do this by opening etc/proxychains.conf and editing the last line, specifying port 1080.

```
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
socks4 127.0.0.1 1080
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Network scanning with ProxyChains will be slow so we will start with only the top 20 ports and expand our scope if needed.

You can speed up network scanning through proxychains by modifying the timeout via the tcp\_read\_time\_out and tcp\_connect\_time\_out values in /etc/proxychains.conf. However, donâ€™t set these too low or you will receive incorrect results.
{% endhint %}

SOCKS proxies require a TCP connection to be made and thus a half-open or SYN scan cannot be used with ProxyChains.740 Since SOCKS proxies require a TCP connection, ICMP cannot get through either and we must disable pinging with the -Pn flag.

```
kali@kali:~$ proxychains nmap --top-ports=20 -sT -Pn 10.5.5.20
```

### nmap proxychains scan

## SSH.exe

The OpenSSH client has been bundled with Windows by default since version 1803 (April 2018 Update),1 and has been available as a Feature-on-Demand since 1709 (Windows 10 Fall Creators Update).2 On Windows versions with SSH installed, we will find scp.exe, sftp.exe, ssh.exe, along with other ssh-\* utilities in %systemdrive%\Windows\System32\OpenSSH location by default.

```
C:\Users\rdp_admin>where ssh

Notably, the version of OpenSSH bundled with Windows is higher than 7.6, meaning we can use it for remote dynamic port forwarding.

{% hint style="info" %}
In much the same way that it's not possible to accept the SSH client key cache prompt from a non-TTY shell on Linux, with some very limited shells with Plink on Windows, we also won't be able to respond to this prompt. An easy solution in that case would be to automate the confirmation with cmd.exe /c echo y, piped into the plink.exe command. This will emulate the confirmation that we usually type when prompted. The entire command would be: cmd.exe /c echo y | .\plink.exe -ssh -l kali -pw -R 127.0.0.1:9833:127.0.0.1:3389 192.168.41.7.

## NETSH

{% hint style="info" %}
The portproxy subcontext of the netsh interface command requires administrative privileges to make any changes. This means that in most cases we will need to take UAC into account. In this example, we're running it in a shell over RDP using an account with administrator privileges, so UAC is not a concern. However, we should bear in mind that UAC may be a stumbling block in other setups.
{% endhint %}

```
xfreerdp /u:rdp_admin /p:P@ssw0rd! /v:192.168.50.64
```

In our RDP session, we can run cmd.exe as administrator to open a command window.

Using this window, we can run Netsh. We'll instruct netsh interface to add a portproxy rule from an IPv4 listener that is forwarded to an IPv4 port (v4tov4). This will listen on port 2222 on the external-facing interface (listenport=2222 listenaddress=192.168.50.64) and forward packets to port 22 on PGDATABASE01 (connectport=22 connectaddress=10.4.50.215).

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
